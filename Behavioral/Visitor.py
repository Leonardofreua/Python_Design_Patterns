"""
The Visitor design pattern is one of the twenty-three well-known GoF design patterns
that describe how to solve recurring design problems to design flexible and reusable object-oriented
software, that is, objects that are easierto implement, change, test, and reuse.

*What problems can the Visitor design pattern solve?

- It should be possible to define a new operation for (some) classes of an object structure without
  changing the classes.
- When new operations are needed frequently and the object structure consists of many unrelated classes,
  it's inflexible to add new subclasses each time a new operation is required because "[..] distributing all
  these operations across the various node classes leads to a system that's hard to understand, maintain, and change."

*What solution does the Visitor design pattern describe?

- Define a separate (visitor) object that implements an operation to be performed on elements of an
  object structure.
- Clients traverse the object structure and call a dispatching operation accept(visitor) on an element â€”
  that "dispatches" (delegates) the request to the "accepted visitor object". The visitor object then performs
  the operation on the element ("visits the element").
